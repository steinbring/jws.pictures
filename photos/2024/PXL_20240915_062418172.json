    "description": "This is the Golden Pavilion in Kyoto. It has burned down numerous times throughout its history, including twice during the Onin War, a civil war that destroyed much of Kyoto, and once again, more recently, in 1950, when a monk set it on fire. The present structure was rebuilt in 1955."
